# Deploying a Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow, Minio andÂ Docker

Comes without much mention in companies, which is the question of datalake, lakehouse or data warehouses. The nomenclature depends a lot on how the data structure is stored, but more than that, we are going to address two tools that are widely used for building a data lake, which is Apche Airflow and Minio.

| So let's understand what these tools are!

* Apache Airflow: Apache Airflow is an open source workflow management platform for data engineering pipelines. Started at Airbnb in October 2014 as a solution to manage the company's increasingly complex workflows.


* Minio: Is a high-performance object store released under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. It is API compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service.
